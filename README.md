# Imbalanced

A Python package for generating, working with, and learning from imbalanced
data.

**N.B. this is WIP and not yet suitable for general use.**


## This package vs. `imbalanced-learn`

This package focuses on neural networks (through PyTorch) and aims to be a
big-data-friendly implementation in terms of storage and memory use.
