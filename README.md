# Imbalanced

Imbalanced learning tools and experimental framework for PyTorch.
Big data friendly.

**N.B. this is WIP and not yet suitable for general use.**


## Why not the original `imbalanced-learn` package?

This package focuses on neural networks (particularly deep architectures) and
aims to be a big-data-friendly implementation in terms of storage and memory
use.
